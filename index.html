				<p>As much as I respect your craft I don’t think you will ever comprehend the amount of thought and effort that goes into my work. I don’t want you to find what I’m about to say disrespectful, I would never want to disrespect you, but I want you to know that we are not in the same field because we’re not even playing the same game. After spending dozens of hours with you for months, I can confidently say that you are not worthy of my work. This book is not for you, and it will never be for you, but it’s not even for you to see, touch, kiss, love, cry over, or mourn, it is not for you to ignore either. My work does have an audience, and that audience is myself and the thousands of people who have gone through the same shit as me or worse, who will forever cherish these pieces as a manifestation of our collective imaginary. That classroom was never “safe”. A place should not only be considered safe when it is free of physical violence or bullying. Violence can imply silence, erasure, lack of empathy. Amplifying our voices also means restructuring curriculums to fit us, our already buried stories and perspectives. And before you victimize yourself, trying to come up with excuses. Remember that victimization of your allyship, blaming it on something greater than you or saying our perspectives or conversations are “beyond the scope of your class”, just showcases true disinterest. This is how violence manifests itself in academia, as a silent monster. We are not here to inform you, nor want to see you as our savior, but we do expect at least a level of involvement besides just quietly listening and exchanging generic words.

                <p>Students. Speak the fuck up. You have a responsibility with yourself, your community, and your environment. True change starts at an individual level, with your mind, and later apply what you’ve learned in spaces like your classroom. Revoke the idea of associating a professor’s value, knowledge, capabilities, with their whiteness. They are only deemed as better because of the institutionalized benefit tied to their skin color. If you don’t believe me, join me for a simple exercise. What person comes to your mind when you hear graphic designer? Is it perhaps Paula Scher? David Carson? Paul Rand? Perhaps the face of your professor comes up. Who can blame you? It is easy to idolize them as they never fail to mention their trajectory. Impecable on record. They excel at teaching. You feel lucky. They feel fulfilled. According to Data USA, as of 2021, 77.3% of the employed graphic design workforce in the US is White, followed by 9% Asian and 4.9% Black. These numbers have stayed consistent over the last five years.

                <p>Your professors are not good professors if most, or all of them, are white.
                 </p>

			<div class="content">
                <p>At school, we live in one hell of a privileged microcosm, isolating us from the actual graphic design landscape. Often thinking a design class environment should only center discussions around design. However, that could not be further from the truth. Art and design, as interconnected as they can be, need to be seen as forms of protest. It is your tool for change. It is your weapon. Never let anyone tell you otherwise. Your design is and will always be your greatest tool for liberation. 

                 </p>

			<div class="content">
                <p>So, how can we create meaningful change? Let’s start with the basics. White students, as queer as you might be, know your place and use your hereditary privilege for good. Black/Brown/Disabled/Trans/Lesbian/Gay or Foreign students, demand centering your narratives in the curriculum. Demand the school for faculty who reflect and bond with your voice, who know what’s like to exist in the margins, who are not afraid to speak up during ongoing genocides. Everyone outside of that scope, stop making up excuses for your lack of perspective. Information has never been this accessible. Your avoidance only makes you complicit. 

                 </p>

			<div class="content">
                <p>Remember that what I’m saying goes beyond terms like “inclusion”, it demands restructuring the institution, it calls for abolition. I was too weak to speak up this year but take this as me exercising my prerogative. You, you can do so much more than what you were made to believe. You can enrich yourself with the knowledge of a thousands lives who came before you, whose descendants can teach you about the stolen land your feet call home, who witness the destruction of their everything. With the utmost respect, listen to them and see through their eyes. Pop that fucking Eurocentric design bubble you are confortable in and start acting. Action can be as passive as learning and as active as protesting. Young Designers, stop desperately trying to please your professors, you are inherently better than them as you are still able to reject their archaic teachings. The world already has high expectations for you, but I have higher. I will make it my lifelong mission to hold designers accountable for their crimes against humanity. And I expect to never see your name on that list.
